## Machine Learning Algorithm from Scratch
This repository contains machine learning algorithm from scratch. From scratch means following algorithms are implemented without using any machine learning library. Numpy and other mathematical libraries are allowed. This is a good way to understand how machine learning algorithms work and how linear algebra is used in machine learning.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Cross Validation

## How to contribute
- Read the [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

## Rules
- All algorithms should be implemented in Python.
- Read the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file.


## Style Guide
- Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
