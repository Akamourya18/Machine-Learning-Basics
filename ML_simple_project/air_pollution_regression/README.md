## Problem statement

Regression Models to Predict Air Pollution from Affordable Data Collections.

## About dataset

The dataset contains 1600 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level,within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year) representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer.

## Structure of the dataset

- Number of entries: 1600
- Number of columns: 6

## Steps for model development

The follow in steps for model development is taken form the book _**Hands on machine learning with scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow**_.

1. Look at the big picture (What the problem is)
2. Get the data (Download the data at correct location)
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insight (Visualization helps to find patterns in the data)
4. Prepare the data for machine learning alogrithms (The better prepared the data the more accurate the predictions)
5. Select a model and train it (Pick model according to the problem)
6. Fine tune your model (Hyperparameter tuning)
7. Present you solution (Test the model on test set and show the result)

## Some advice and suggestions

1. Carefully study the data, in the notebook and visually.
2. Cross validating the model is always helpful.
3. There are categorical values in the dataset which needs to be handeled.
4. After selecting on model experiment with some other model to see which perform better.
