# Simple Machine Learning projects

The purpose of these _four_ projects is to get your toes wet with some ML projects. The projects are such:
1. Housing prices prediction with linear regression
2. Logistic regression
3. SVM classification
4. Decision tree classification


The first problem uses the _'California housing prices'_ dataset. The rest of the classification problems uses the MNIST dataset which is a collection of hand written digits (ranging from 0 to 9) as images.

## Project guidelines
1. Carefull study the datasets.
2. The project files must be jupyter notebooks.
3. Code should follow the style guide mentioned **here** (insert the link)
4. All projects must mention (and show) their efficiency, such as the MSE, RMSE, confusion matricies, etc.
