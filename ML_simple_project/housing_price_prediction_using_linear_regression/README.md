# Housing price prediction

## Problem statement
Given the dataset of california housing prices make a _**linear regression**_ model to predict the price, given some input features.

## Structure of the dataset
- Number of entries: 20640
- Number of columns: 10

## Steps for model development
The follow in steps for model development is taken form the book _**Hands on machine learning with scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow**_.

1. Look at the big picture (What the problem is)
2. Get the data (Download the data at correct location)
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insight (Visualization helps to find patterns in the data)
4. Prepare the data for machine learning alogrithms (The better prepared the data the more accurate the predictions)
5. Select a model and train it (Pick model according to the problem)
6. Fine tune your model (Hyperparameter tuning)
7. Present you solution (Test the model on test set and show the result)

## Some advice and suggestions
1. Carefully study the data, in the notebook and visually.
2. Cross validating the model is always helpful.
3. There are categorical values in the dataset which needs to be handeled.
4. After selecting on model experiment with some other model to see which perform better.
